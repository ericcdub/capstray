# CapsTray
An app for displaying a Windows system's caps lock status in the system tray
# Why on Earth would I use this?
Many wireless PC keyboards don't have a little LED for displaying whether the caps lock is engaged or not.

This is particularly annoying when typing in password fields and you think you're typing uppercase letters when you're not, or vice versa.

CapsTray inserts a tiny icon in your Windows system tray
which changes when the caps lock is engaged ![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericcdub/capstray/master/CapsTray/icons/upper.ico) or disengaged ![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericcdub/capstray/master/CapsTray/icons/lower.ico).
It's unintrusive, there are no annoying pop ups and it's easy to use.

# How Do I Install it #

You'll need a current version of Visual Studio community edition or better to build the project. Clone this repo, compile, and run.
